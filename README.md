# Note

Currently it is on research stage and I am improving the code. Soon I will release the notebook for training and inference

# Training
## Download the dataset
### Download the MPV dataset from Image-based Multi-pose Virtual Try On and put the dataset under "./dataset/images/".
### Select postive perspective images, create dataset split file 'data_pair.txt', and put it under "./dataset/".
## Dataset preprocessing
### Pose keypoints. Use the Openpose, and put the keypoints file in "./dataset/pose_coco".
### Semantic parsing. Use the CIHP_PGN, and put the parsing results in "./dataset/parse_cihp".
### Cloth mask. Use the removebg api or holistically-nested-edge-detection for the cloth mask, and put the mask in "./dataset/cloth_mask".
## Coarse-to-fine training
### Download the VGG19 pretrained checkpoint
### cd vgg_model/
### wget https://download.pytorch.org/models/vgg19-dcbb9e9d.pth
### Set different configuration based on the "config.py". Then run
``` sh train.sh ```
